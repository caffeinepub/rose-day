# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a toggleable “special message” button on the Rose Day page and make the updated site available via a shareable public URL.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a clearly visible button within the Rose Day card (near the message/signature) that toggles showing/hiding a special message block.
- Ensure the button interaction does not trigger the page-level emoji burst click behavior (prevent click/tap bubbling to the root handler).
- Deploy the updated site so it’s accessible via a public, shareable URL.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can tap/click a “Show a special message” button on the Rose Day card to reveal and hide an extra message, and the page is live at a public URL that can be shared.
